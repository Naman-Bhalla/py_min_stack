# py_min_stack

Python implementation of a Stack that supports find_min() alongwith usual stack operations.

The time and space complexities of find_min() are as follows:

  - O(1) Amortized Time
  - O(1) Space

Push, Pop are O(1) time as usual.

# Motivation

I needed to use a Min Queue for a particular task and it can be implemented easily using 2 
Min Stacks.
